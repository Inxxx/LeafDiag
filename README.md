## LeafDiag
This my undergraduate final year project. LeafDiag is an *Android* mobile application which can automatically identify the plants diseases based on its leaf appearance with some **computer vision** and **machine learning** techniques. The target group of the user is those who request a free and quick diagnosis on common leaf disease at any time of the day. EM and Otsu algorithms were used for segmentation. Color histogram and Tamuraâ€™s texture feature were extracted. *ANN, SVM* and *Random Forest* learning models were built respectively. Experiments and evaluations on different segmentations, feature extractions and classification methods were done to find the most effective approach. The higest average accuracy is **96.4%**. Another desktop version was also developed. The application was mainly built with *Java and Matlab*. It was rewarded as a **first class project**. The source code can be access [here](https://github.com/psyyz10/LeafDiag). The report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/psyyz10/LeafDiag/blob/master/project.pdf).
